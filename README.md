📚 Book Recommendation System (NLP-based)

Overview

This project is a content-based book recommendation system built with Python.
Given a book title, the system analyzes book descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and recommends similar books based on textual similarity.

The recommendations are generated by comparing book descriptions using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, providing a transparent and explainable similarity score for each recommendation.

🧠 How It Works

1. Data Loading (pandas)

The project uses pandas to load and manage structured book data from a CSV file:

df = pd.read_csv('books.csv')

Each row represents a book with the following fields:
	•	TITLE
	•	AUTHOR
	•	GENRE
	•	YEAR
	•	DESCRIPTION

Pandas allows fast indexing, filtering, and clean interaction with the dataset.

2. Text Vectorization (TF-IDF)

Book descriptions are converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency):

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['DESCRIPTION'].fillna(''))

Why TF-IDF?
	•	Highlights important words in each description
	•	Downweights common words shared across many books
	•	Produces a meaningful vector representation of text content

Each book becomes a vector in a high-dimensional space where each dimension represents a word.

3. Similarity Calculation (Cosine Similarity)

To measure how similar two books are, the system uses cosine similarity:

cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)

Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors, not their magnitude:
	•	1.0 → very similar
	•	0.0 → unrelated

This makes it ideal for comparing text documents of different lengths.

4. Realistic Similarity Scoring

Raw cosine similarity values are not directly user-friendly.
Instead of forcing the top recommendation to always be 100%, the system applies soft normalization:
	•	Scores are scaled for readability
	•	An upper cap is applied to avoid artificial “perfect matches”
	•	This reflects the approximate and subjective nature of literary similarity

The result is a score that feels honest and interpretable, not inflated.

5. Semantic Match Labels

Each recommendation includes a semantic interpretation layer based on its similarity score:
	•	Very strong thematic match
	•	Strong thematic overlap
	•	Moderate similarity
	•	Loose conceptual connection

These labels help translate numeric similarity into intuitive, human-readable insight.

6. Recommendation Logic

When a user inputs a book title:
	1.	The title is converted to lowercase to allow case-insensitive matching
	2.	The system finds the index of the selected book
	3.	Similarity scores between that book and all others are retrieved
	4.	Results are sorted by similarity
	5.	The top 5 most similar books are returned (excluding the original book)

Each recommendation includes a Similarity Score, calculated as:

        normalized_score = round((score / max_score) * 100, 2)
        if normalized_score >= 75:
            label = 'Very strong thematic match'
        elif normalized_score >= 50:
            label = 'Strong thematic overlap'
        elif normalized_score >= 30:
            label = 'Moderate similarity'
        else:
            label = 'Loose conceptual connection'

This transforms a mathematical similarity value into an interpretable percentage.

7. Terminal Interface & Visualization

The user interacts with the system through the terminal:

Ingresa el titulo de tu libro favorito: dune

Results are displayed using colorama for clarity and readability:
	•	Titles
	•	Metadata (author, year, genre)
	•	Description
	•	Similarity score

This improves usability without adding GUI complexity.
